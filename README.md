refactor Mayah's main.js cc-d4

### GOAL : 
#### Time complexity analysis:

Only one loop and a delay so complexity is O(n)


#### Memory Analysis : 

Function executes itself n times so Memory usage is n * number of variables executed per loop_step.

So the result is also O(n)

### Description : 
This is a simple exercise where we learn to evaluate some program's complexity and the space taken by their execution.
